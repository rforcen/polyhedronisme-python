polyHÃ©dronisme
===============

This is a project built to demonstrate the
[Conway Polyhedral Operators][1] and their extensions by
[George W. Hart][2] and others. It was heavily inspired by some 
[old code][3] of George Hart's that did much the same in VRML.  
Additional operators are being added to increase the range of 
procedurally generated forms possible.

One derives any of a vast family of polyhedral shapes by specifying a
core geometric 'seed' and then modifying it with topological and
geometrical operators that derive more complex shapes from this base
set.

This project was also inspired by the renaissance tome
[Perspectiva Corporum Regularium][4] featuring [engravings][perspectiva] by Jost
Amman after designs and drawings by Wenzel Jamnitzer.

This still uses an HTML5 canvas renderer, as it was written long ago 
before webGL really worked.  It uses jQuery, underscore, [PEG.js][5] parser 
for parsing recipes, and [Eli Grey's][eli] Blob.js, FileSaver, 
canvas-toBlob for saving files.
